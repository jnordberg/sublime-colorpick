## about

For me, a colorpicker is the last piece of the puzzle to make Sublime Text 2 a complete
TextMate replacement. Et voilà!

Source for the colorpick binary can be found at https://github.com/jnordberg/color-pick

## installation

    cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages
    git clone git://github.com/jnordberg/sublime-colorpick.git ColorPick

It's important that you check out the repo as ColorPick as the plugin will look for the binary in
`<sublime packages dir>/ColorPick/bin/colorpick`

## usage

`cmd+shift+c` to insert a color

or bind it to a key of your choosing, the command is `color_pick`

## options

If you prefer your colors to be uppercase (`#FF0000` vs `#ff0000`), set the `color_pick_upcase` option in your user settings (`cmd+comma`)

Example:

```json
{
  "font_face": "Menlo",
  "font_size": 11.0,
  "tab_size": 2,
  "word_wrap": true,
  "wrap_width": 90, 
  "color_pick_upcase": true
}
```
